## About

A full-stack decentralized application (dApp) that leverages blockchain technology to conduct voting. This dApp includes a Solidity smart contract for managing elections and a user-friendly web interface built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It also utilizes The Graph for efficient data querying and ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for interacting with the dApp
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) for running the frontend

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Voting-dapp
3. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
4. Install the required dependencies for the front end:
   ```bash
   npm install
5. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
6. Connect your wallet (MetaMask) to the dApp to participate in elections.

## Usage
- Election 
- Register as a Candidate: If you want to run for office, you can register as a candidate.
- Register as a Voter: If you're eligible to vote, you can register as a voter.
- Vote: During the voting period, you can vote for your preferred candidate.
- View Results: Once the election ends, you can view the election results.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity: Used for developing the smart contract to manage elections.
- React.js: Created the user interface for the dApp.
- Tailwind CSS: Styled the frontend components.
- The Graph: Utilized for efficient data querying.
- ethers.js: Interacted with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Smart Contract
The Solidity smart contract is responsible for managing elections, candidates, and voters. The contract includes functions for candidate and voter registration, voting, and result declaration.

## Frontend
The React.js frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the smart contract. Users can register as candidates and voters, vote during the voting period, and view election results.

## The Graph
The Graph is used to efficiently query data from the Ethereum blockchain. It optimizes data retrieval and enhances the dApp's performance.

## ethers.js
Ether.js is used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing the dApp to send and receive data securely.
